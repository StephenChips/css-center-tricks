# Completed the System's Coding.

1. Finished the method "setActivedItem" of the "Menu" class, so that we can setup the initial actived item when initializing
the system.

2. Added remaining examples for "CodePane" through the "addExample" method, and added correspondening menu items for "NavMenu"
and "SideMenu".

# Adjusted the Webpack's Configuration.

1. Deleted the Old webpack configuation "webpack.conf.js", and replaced it with two new configuations: 
"webpack.dev.js" & "webpack.prod.js", which are for "development" mode and "production" mode, respectively.

2. Created a new directory "/prod/dist" for containing the production mode's bundle created by webpack.

3. Modified production mode's output path, a "publicPath" is appended before the original path. After such modification,
all bundles are recreated.

4. Installed the plugin "CleanWebpackPlugin" into the project. It can empty the output directory first before webpack
writes the new one.

UI component explained:

1. "CodePane" is the pane at the center of the page, which shows the example codes and style snippet, and can show the rendering result
of the example if you click the "Show Result" button above it.

2. "NavMenu" is the menu at the top of the page, which provides options that switch to another different example.

3. "SideMenu" is the menu at the left of the page, which provides options at switch to another different page.
